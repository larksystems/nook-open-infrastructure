# Nook Open Infrastructure

This repository contains code and instructions for deploying the backend infrastructure needed to run a [Nook](https://github.com/larksystems/nook) instance.

For an overview of the infrastructure, you can have a look at the [architecture](./documentation/architecture.md) documentation, and for deployment, you can follow the steps outline in the [setup guide](./documentation/setup_guide.md).

For a quick user guide to the user interfaces for Katikati, and a project planning template, please see [the resources in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/6/folders/1AVY5DLMHCAfoh3HQJHWF4fI-2nyLXkcJ).
